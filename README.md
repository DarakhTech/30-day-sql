# 30-Day SQL LeetCode Challenge 

SQL is a vital skill for data analysis, backend development, and many tech roles. This challenge will help you:
- Build confidence in solving SQL problems efficiently.
- Strengthen your understanding of key concepts like `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `HAVING`, `RANK`, and more.
- Practice interview-style questions commonly used by top companies.
- Develop a habit of consistent learning and growth.

## üóìÔ∏è The Plan

Each day, I‚Äôll solve one SQL question from **LeetCode**, covering a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems. The challenge spans across 30 days, with a new problem every day. By the end of this challenge, you‚Äôll be more comfortable tackling SQL problems of varying complexity. I might have already solved many of these before, so will try to retry as well as solve a random question and mention it with date in extras.
